# 2017FRCSerialCommunicationTest

This project aims to demonstrate how RoboRIO and RaspberyPi could communicate through serial ports. 

To do this, you will need to wire the UART TDX, RDX and ground pins on raspberrypi with corresponding pins on the MXP of the RoboRIO. Then you need to deploy and run code on both sides (use sudo for code running on Raspberrypi).
